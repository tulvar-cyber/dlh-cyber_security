## Nmap Live Host Discovery
-----------------------------

0. Will arp be enough ?
Write a bash script that scan a subnetwork to discover live host using ARP scan.
You should use nmap.
Your code should tell nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery.
You should run your code as privileged user. root or sudoers.
Your script should accept a subnetwork as an arguments $1.
Depending on the scanned subnetwork, the output could change. We can't expect to learn about the Target MAC Address, unless we are in the the same subnetwork.

5. Are your privileged enough to scan me ?

Write a bash script that scan a subnetwork to discover live host using **TCP ACK Ping ** scan.
You should use nmap.
Your code should tell nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery.
Your code should scan for those ports 22,80,443.
You should run your code as privileged user. root or sudoers.
Your script should accept a subnetwork as an arguments $1.
Depending on the scanned subnetwork, the output could change. Unprivileged users have no choice but to complete the 3-way handshake if the port is open.

7. Simple Catch, is it mimicked ?
Time To Ping The Target (cybernetsec_0x04)
Catch the flag time is on, here is some tips:
You should run your scan as privileged user. root or sudoers.
The Current Flag is hidden within UDP opened port service VERSION
Two hundred, Three hundred but no more. -p200-300
